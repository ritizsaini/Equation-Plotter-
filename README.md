# Equation-Plotter-

- equation plotter a software that plots the graph of y = f(x) function which is inputted by the user on the console screen. The software will also provide the user data about the critical points, inflection points, roots of the function and it will also provide the user the graphs of the functionâ€™s integral & differential on his/her will. If the user will be able to see them together.


### Algorithm:  
-for the input fuction, I assigned a value of x from range (say -10 to 10) and then find the corresponding values of y and store it. So given f(x,y)=0, we get an equation F(y)=0, and then I find the roots using NewtonRaphson Method. In this method, we take an arbitrary value x near the actual root. Then a tangent is drawn through that corresponding f(x). Where the tangent line touches the x-axis, that is our new x. So as we repeat this algorithm, we get closer and closer to the actual value of root.
